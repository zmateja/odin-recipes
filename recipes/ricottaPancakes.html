    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you haven’t added ricotta to your pancake game-you’re truly missing out. I know, I know. Cheese in a pancake sounds awful. But stay with me. Ricotta transforms pancakes into airy, creamy, custardy delights. Once you taste these luscious ricotta pancakes, you’ll be making them non-stop.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Cup Flour</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>1/8 Tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 Cup Ricotta</li>
        <li>1 Cup Milk</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Oil, For cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate the eggs into yolks and whites. Set the whites aside. Beat the egg yolks until they run in a smooth stream through the tines of a fork.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt to a small bowl. Whisk it together to incorporate it fully.</li>
        <li>Add the strained ricotta, milk, beaten egg yolks, and vanilla to a large bowl. Mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients on top of the ricotta mixture and gently fold it in.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Add a few tablespoons of the fluffy egg whites to the batter and stir them in to lighten it.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining egg whites to the top of the batter and fold them in with a spatula. Lumps are OK; if you over-mix, you will remove all the air from the batter.</li>
        <li>Place a medium-sized pan over medium heat. Add a 1/2 tablespoon of oil to the pan. Use a 1/3 cup ladle or measuring cup to add batter to the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook the pancake until you see a few bubbles popping through the batter, about 3 minutes. Flip the pancake and cook another 2 minutes until golden. Repeat with the remaining batter. Add 1/2 tablespoon of oil as needed. Makes about 8 pancakes.</li>
